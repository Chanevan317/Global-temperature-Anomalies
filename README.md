# 🌍 Global Temperature Website

This is a simple website to visualize global surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present. It uses CSV data and JavaScript (Chart.js) to display two interactive charts:

- **Annual Temperature Anomalies**: Line graph showing the global average anomaly per year.
- **Monthly Anomalies by Year**: Line chart with a slider to choose any year and view its monthly anomalies.
